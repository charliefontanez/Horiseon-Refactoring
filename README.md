# Horiseon Website Refactoring


## Description

This is a project to go through the code on an existing website and restructure the code in order to improve the website with user accessibility for the disabled and to improve the sites results in search engines.


In this situatuion, a marketing agency has tasked me with restructoring their codebase in order to follow accessibilty standards for the disabled and so their own site is optimized for search engines.
