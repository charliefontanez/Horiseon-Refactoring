# Horiseon Website Refactoring
Restructuring an old website to create an easy to follow and logical structure.


## Description

This is a project where I go through the code on an existing website and restructure the code in order to improve the website with user accessibility for the disabled and to improve the sites results in search engines.


In this situatuion, a marketing agency has tasked me with restructoring their codebase in order to follow accessibilty standards for disabled users, and so their site is optimized for search engines.
